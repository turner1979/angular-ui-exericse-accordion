## Notes

- Used [font squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) to generate woff2 and woff fonts using the supplied ttf font.
- I had an issue with the supplied **plus-icon.svg**, file seemed corrupted? So used a different SVG icon here [iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/x-mark-1-svg/)
